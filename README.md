# Energy Price News API

A project to create a public API that scrapes news sites for anything concerning the changes in energy prices.

This project's secondary aim is to help beginners learn how to contribute to open source projects and will be purposely kept as basic as possible.

Up to date version hosted at: **TBC**

### Original Idea
This project was first thought up after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK4Pl-GmPHk&t=3184s) by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw), so many thanks to her for the inspiration. Be sure to check the channel out for more easy to follow tutorials!

## Planned Features
- Links to articles
- End points for specific sources
- Thorough documentation
- An open and inviting issue-board to encourage discussion of future features

## Language & Prerequisites
- Javascript primarily, therefore:
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
    - [NPM](https://npmjs.org)
- A browser extension for viewing JSON is helpful like [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)

## Installation
- Fork this repo and then clone your fork to an empty local directory using SSH
- run:
```ssh
npm install
```
- Now the basis of the project is here and can already be viewed by running:
```ssh
npm run start
```
- You may view the various endpoints by opening `localhost:8000` in your browser and appending the desired route
    - e.g. `localhost:8000/news`
